//! Domain features (feature-first layout, aligned with frontend `src/lib`).
//!
//! Tauri-free service bodies live in `agentero_core::features::*` and are
//! bridged here; callers use the semantic `crate::features::<domain>::<module>`
//! paths. This crate keeps the desktop shells: `#[tauri::command]` surfaces,
//! JobCenter runners, watcher/agent/integration wiring. The headless CLI
//! consumes `agentero_core` directly; BYOA (`agent`) is desktop-only.
